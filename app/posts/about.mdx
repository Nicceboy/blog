    # About this page
</div>

The page is a personal blog where my opinions are my own and do not represent my employer or any other organization, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

The website was built with an overly complicated, modern
front-end stack. 
The features of the blog will also increase over the time. If there are more than 10 posts some day, I will add search and category filter, but not likely before.
To not disappoint Rube Goldberg[^1], the search will be also something extraordinaly unnecessary, likely SIMD accelerated WASM.
    

[^1]: Rube Goldberg is known for his humorous illustrations of [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) doing simple tasks in overly complicated way.
